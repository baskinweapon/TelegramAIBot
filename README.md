Organisation: "Призыв к совести" Telegram Bot with AI. Hackathon  "Internetborders.net"

This project aims to develop a prototype of a dialogue AI-Bot for the "Appeal to Conscience" legal hotline project. Currently, the hotline receives approximately 300 requests for legal assistance per week. During the peak of mobilization, this number reached 1000-1500 requests per week. All requests are processed manually through a Telegram bot. Therefore, the idea arose to develop an "intelligent" bot that could classify requests by keywords, partially automate the dialogue with the user, and provide them with the necessary instructions.
